<h1>Class led small project. Introduction to Android Studio</h1>

<h3>Application is designed to help users decide how many pizzas to order based on 2 forms of criteria.</h3>
<ol><li>How many people are going to be eating pizza
<li>How hungry is everyone</ol>

<h3>There are 3 options to choose from, depending on how hungry the party is:</h3>
<ol><li>Light
<li>Medium
<li>Ravenous</ol>

<h3>How does the application work</h3>
<p>When you open the application you will first be asked the number of people in your party.
<p>Then you will need to enter in how hungry everyone is!</p>
